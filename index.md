Simple Blog Theme is a clean, responsive blogging theme for Jekyll, with social features. It is inspired by the Cayman Blog Theme.

This theme has all you need to start today blogging with Jekyll, and no effort: pages, posts, few social buttons. Try loading this on mobile too.

It has already a Facebook Page associated with it, which gathers all the interactions.

{% include facebook-page-summary.html %}

Have a look at the Github page for more information.

You find this descriptive text in the `index.md` file, so you can change it, or remove it completely, according to your needs.
